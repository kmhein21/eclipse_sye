Erika Email:

Here’s a link to a onedrive folder with data. I also sent you an “invite” to the same folder but I’m always suspicious so here it is again.
 
Let me explain what’s in there:
 
There are 10 .wav files from a single location/deployment/audiomoth. Each is 55 seconds long, and they are named  as date_time.wav
 
Each .wav file is accompanied by 2 other files. 
 
One is a .txt file labeled date_time.Table.1.selections.txt – these files are the hand annotations I did for the accompanying .wav file using that Raven software I showed you – my own identification of what is in each 55 second .wav file, no AI involved.
 
The other is a .csv file labeled data_time.BirdNET.results.csv – these files are the results from running the Cornell Lab of Ornithology BirdNET algorithm to automatically identify what is in each sound file.
